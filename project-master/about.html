    <p>I moved to London in August 2018, as a freelancer and entrepreneur i needed to find a place to work from.<br/>
      To my surprise i couldn't find all the information i needed in one place and had to search the web for diffrent sites and sum up the information myself.<br/>
      In every site i had to scroll down to find the right information and in many cases I had to look for the location of the places seperatly because most of the sites just state the addrress without giving a link to a map or stating in wich part of the city the place is.<br/>
      On top of that, a few places i went to were packed with people, had a surprise time limit or not work friendly at all..<br/>
      You get the picture...  <br/>
      It was such a waste of time and effort that i decided to try and create a site that would make make others lives easier. <br/>
      A site with all the information a freelancer needs about places to work from.<br/>
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>*Side note: I hope this will become at some point a user based collection of data and maybe in the future a platform for people to connect on a more friendly level.<br/>
        As a newcomer to London working from home i was missing some simple, friendly human interaction with likeminded people. </p>
